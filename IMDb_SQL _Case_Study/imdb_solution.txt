-- Extra Assignment:

-- 1) Split the value '1234_1234' into 2 seperate columns having 1234 each.

SELECT SPLIT_PART('1234_1234', '_',1) as Column1,
SPLIT_PART('1234_1234', '_',2) as Column2;

SELECT SUBSTRING('1234_1234',1, POSITION('_' IN '1234_1234')-1) AS Column1
	, SUBSTRING('1234_1234',POSITION('_' IN '1234_1234')+1) AS Column2


-- 2) We see a string value 'PG' in released_year and we hardcoaded it, can we make a query dynamic to identify string value incase if we have multiple string values in-order to ignore those string values
 Write a query to identify non numeric values in a column.
